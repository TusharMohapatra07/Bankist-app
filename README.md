# Bankist-app

Welcome to Bankist-app, my new JavaScript project: a fictional banking application.

**Note:** The homepage is not responsive!! Prefer using this on screens with a width of more than 800px for the best experience.

## About the Homepage:
The main goal behind building this part is to work on the UI aspects such as lazy-loading, scroll animations, sliders, etc.

## About the Login Page:
This part of the application is responsive. The main goal behind this part is to work on features like date, timers, updating the page without reloading it, etc.

### Some of the features to mention:
- Request for a loan which will add an amount to the account
- Transfer amount to another user. The UI on both accounts will be updated
- Close account
- Sort movements
- A fake login-like interface
- Auto logout, where the page logs the user out when there is no activity for 5 minutes straight
- A fake logout-like functionality

Please feel free to use the applications with 4 default users. Please use the full name (case-sensitive) and password to login.

## Setup Instructions :

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**

    If this project is hosted on a version control system like Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TusharMohapatra07/Bankist-app.git
    cd Bankist-app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    This project uses Node.js and npm. Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command installs all packages listed in `package.json` into the `node_modules` directory.

3.  **Start the Development Server:**

    This project is configured with a development server that automatically reloads the browser when you make changes. To start it, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    **Important:** Once you run `npm start`, the server will usually run in your terminal. You'll need to keep this terminal window open while you're developing. The server will provide you with a local URL (usually `http://localhost:<port>` or `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`) that you can open in your web browser to view the project.
