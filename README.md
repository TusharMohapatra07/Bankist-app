# Bankist-app

Welcome to Bankist-app, my new JavaScript project: a fictional banking application.

**Note:** The homepage is not responsive!! Prefer using this on screens with a width of more than 800px for the best experience.

## About the Homepage:
The main goal behind building this part is to work on the UI aspects such as lazy-loading, scroll animations, sliders, etc.

## About the Login Page:
This part of the application is responsive. The main goal behind this part is to work on features like date, timers, updating the page without reloading it, etc.

### Some of the features to mention:
- Request for a loan which will add an amount to the account
- Transfer amount to another user. The UI on both accounts will be updated
- Close account
- Sort movements
- A fake login-like interface
- Auto logout, where the page logs the user out when there is no activity for 5 minutes straight
- A fake logout-like functionality

Please feel free to use the applications with 4 default users. Please use the full name (case-sensitive) and password to login.
