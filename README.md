# Bankist-app
My new JS project: A fictional banking application </br>
</br>
 NOTE: The homepage is not responsive!! Prefer using this on screen of width more than 800px for best experience.</br>
</br>
 About the homepage:</br>
   The main goal behind building this part is to work on UI part such as lazy-loading, scroll animations, sliders etc.</br>
</br>
 About the Login page:</br>
   This part of application is responsive. The main goal behind this part is to work on things like date, timers, updating the page w/o reloading it etc.</br>
       Some of the features to mention:</br>
	          * request for a loan which will add amount to the account</br>
	          * transfer amount to another user. The UI on both accounts will be updated</br>
	          * close account </br>
	          * sort movements</br>
	          * a fake login-like interface</br>
	          * auto logout in which the page logs the user out when there is no activity for 5 minutes straight</br>
	          * a fake logout-like functionality</br>
